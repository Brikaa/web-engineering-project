# REST architecture
- All query parameters
- Map routes to functions, there can exist multiple routes of the same name but with different methods
  - router = {
    "route": {
      "method": function
    }
  }
  - For every request, get method and check router["route"]["method"]
- Some functions have access to database
  - Database controller
- Some functions need the user to be authorized as a certain role, some functions need access to the user context
  - Database controller wrapper function
- Functions need to check valid request body
  - Try, catch -> return 500; console error
- Frontend
  - All JavaScript?
    - Head, body in HTML
    - Create body function
      - Clears current body
      - Determines navbar
      - Does template
    - Component functions call create body function with appropriate html

# MVC architecture (chosen)
- API functions
- Some functions have access to database
  - Database controller
- Some functions need the user to be authorized as a certain role, some functions need access to the user context
  - Database controller wrapper function
- Views are functions that accept api functions
  - function api_fun1()
    - with_db(function(db) { with_auth(db, controllerFunction) })
- The user lands on a central component that loads the appropriate view according to the action param
- Almost no JavaScript
